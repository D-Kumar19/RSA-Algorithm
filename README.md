# RSA-Algorithms
This repository will contain an implementation of RSA Algorithms

***
In this Repository I have created different classes for each functionality in RSA Algorithm.
   * Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find GCD.
   * Fast Modular Algorithm to find Modulus of an Exponentiation.
   * Miller Rabin Algorithm to check if a Number is Prime or not.
   * Random Gernerator to randomly generate Prime Numbers.
   * Chinese Remainder Algorithm for generating Decryption Key.
   * RSA Algorithm for generating both Private and Public Keys.
   * Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate Prime Numbers in a range which will help us making the whole process fast.
